I want to write a matrix library
First, I wanted to compare fork and threads performances in matrix multiplications

I need a matrix class
    * A vector of vectors vector<vector<float>>
    * A multiplication function that uses threads
    * A multiplication function that uses fork


Expected result : threads are quicker than fork

Fork duplicates all the process while thread does not


RAII (Resource acquisition is initialization): 
    . How do I supposed to implement this ? 
        => In the constructor, declare a shared memory space with mmap, in which I'll
            put the matrix data (vector of vectors). Actually, all the vectors must be 
            in a shared memory space. 
        => In the destructor, I'll free all the ressources (unmap the shared memory space)
